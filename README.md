# Welcome to the Vertical Slabs git
Vertical Slabs is a mod that adds vertical slabs to Minecraft.
## Installing
This mod requires Forge for Minecraft 1.16.2. Once you have installed it, place the mod file into the mods folder in .minecraft.

## Crafting
Each slab can be crafted with its vanilla normal slab counterpart, and can be crafted back into its vanilla normal slab counterpart as well. Additionally, you can use a stonecutter to craft vertical slabs from stone and similar materials, just as you can with the vanilla slabs.
